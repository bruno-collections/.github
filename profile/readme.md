# 🐾 Bruno Collections

Welcome to the **Bruno Collections** GitHub organization — curated workflows and service demos powered by [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com), the modern, open-source API client built for developers.

> 🧠 Think of this repo as a library of plug-and-play Bruno collections — whether you're exploring a new API, building out a dev workflow, or sharing how your service works, we want to have a collection for that.

## 📁 What's in Here?

This GitHub org is home to **community-driven and internally curated Bruno collections** designed to:

- Highlight specific services or APIs 
- Showcase best practices or workflows
- Act as live, editable documentation via [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com)

Each collection lives in its own repo and includes:

- A `Fetch in Bruno` button. [See docs here.](https://docs.usebruno.com/git-integration/embed-bruno-collection)
- A Bruno collection 
- A brief `README.md` explaining the use case
- Optional example responses, docs, or companion scripts
